Gnome 3 CERN Hot news shell extension
====================

WARNING: This plugin is probably not useful for anyone else except CERN employees. It displays the same news you get
using the official CERN Scientific Linux or NICE Windows. This means it is usually stuff related to the CERN site
as you can see here: [CERN Alerts RSS feed](http://cernalerts.web.cern.ch/cernalerts/?feed=cern%20hot%20news)

This is not an official CERN plugin. It is a pet project to learn about gnome shell extensions and to have something
useful for me at the same time.

Beeing aware of the things mentioned above you can use it however you want.

To install the extension just use:
git clone https://github.com/andreaslang/gnome3_cern_hot_news.git ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/CERN_Hot_News@andreas.al.lang.gmail.com

Then press Alt+F2 and enter 'r' to reload your shell and go to https://extensions.gnome.org/local/ to activate it.
